Tripping Photo Manager
======================

Android app to manage photos in an SD card.

When you're on a long trip and you don't want to carry around a heavy computer just to manage your camera's SD card, this app can be a helpful tool. Using your tablet's SD card reader (or an OTG cable, if it has none) you can manage the photos taken in your trip, preview your snaps and make room for more by deleting those that you don't want.
